# AiCAN

## Overview
The program is designed to automate the submission of predefined property descriptions to the AiCAN (run.exe) system. When a property description is submitted to AiCAN, the system generates a "result.json" file as a response.

The program starts by copying "input.json" files. Upon the appearance of "result.json", generated by the AiCAN system, it moves this file to the respective "input.json" folder. The program iterates through all specified "input.json" files.

After processing each pair of "input.json" and "result.json", it compiles the data into an "output.csv" file. This output presents a table with evaluated property details, structured with specific columns for easy import into Excel or as a CSV file.

Upon completion of the submission and processing tasks, the program provides a summary indicating the number of successful operations.
